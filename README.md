# google-trends-graph

The Python library for accessing and visualizing Google Trends data is called Pytrends. Pytrends allows users to retrieve and analyze Google Trends data directly from Python code.

To use Pytrends, you first need to create a Pytrends object and authenticate it with your Google account credentials. You can then use this object to retrieve Google Trends data for specific search terms, time ranges, and geographic locations. Pytrends returns the data as a Pandas DataFrame, which you can manipulate and analyze using Python's powerful data analysis tools.

Once you have retrieved and cleaned the data, you can use Python's data visualization libraries, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, to create various types of charts and graphs, including line charts, bar charts, and heatmaps, to visualize the trends over time.

Overall, Pytrends is a useful tool for data analysts, researchers, and marketers who want to explore and analyze Google search trends data programmatically using Python.
